<h3>Make the debug Xcode more obvious</h3>

<p>It&#39;s annoying trying to keep track of which Xcode is the one you&#39;re doing work on, no in. I had heard that there is a hidden Red Xcode mode to differentiate between debugging Xcode and dev Xcode, but I could never find out the trigger. Instead I built a plugin that checks for an attached debugger and it will hue shift the icon. Nothing big, nothing fancy, but it&#39;s a useful tool to have under your belt.</p>
