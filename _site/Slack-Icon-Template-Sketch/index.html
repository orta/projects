<h1>Slack icon template for Sketch</h1>

<p>Slack is now being used by both <a href="http://artsy.net">Artsy</a>, and by <a href="http://cocoapods.org">CocoaPods</a>. I don&#39;t want to get confused which instance of slack people are talking on. So I made a CocoaPods varient of the log, and cleaned it up so people can quickly change some colors and export a png to use in <a href="http://fluidapp.com">Fluid.app</a>.</p>
