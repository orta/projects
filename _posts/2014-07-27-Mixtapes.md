# Mixtapes

Mixtapes is a digital love letter. It's a way of creating easily updated mixtapes via spotify. My girlfriend moved to Australia for a year, and I wanted to share songs. This worked out great. You assign it a folder in your Spotify account and any playlists created in there are synced for offline play.
