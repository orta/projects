# Slack icon template for Sketch

Slack is now being used by both [Artsy](http://artsy.net), and by [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). I don't want to get confused which instance of slack people are talking on. So I made a CocoaPods variant of the logo, and cleaned it up so people can quickly change some colors and export a png to use in [Fluid.app](http://fluidapp.com).
