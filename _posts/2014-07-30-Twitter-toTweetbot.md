# Open Twitter links in Tweetbot

I got annoyed at the amount of times I had to open tweetbot then go to a username. So I fixed the root of the problem which is that people link to `twitter.com/name` with a Safari & Chrome extension. It will take any twitter link and convert it to one that opens Tweetbot instead. Perfect.
