# Kierononononononononononon

I can't think of where to start. The band was something I did for 6 years, and still defines a lot of who I am today. Originally started so I could hang out with [floatstarpx](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClrzmF86hMI) and [Goat Boy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lwsb_Ed7ffE&feature=youtu.be).

We made huge amounts of [music](http://kieronononon.heroku.com/music), did stupid [music videos](http://kieronononon.heroku.com/video), [games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KfGRNraFvkg) & [magazines](http://kieronononon.heroku.com/kommunique).  We're on spotify, you should check out the [Kierononon Pop hits](http://open.spotify.com/user/floatstarpx/playlist/2RwwYULvleH0jaRUuzLp4I) playlist. There's an amazing page on the wesite [just for complaints](http://kieronononon.heroku.com/komplaint). I'm not sure we recieve those emails anymore.

Being in a band is a lot like a relationship, we had our ups and downs and came out very different people. It was an amazing time.

It was with the band that I really learned product design.
