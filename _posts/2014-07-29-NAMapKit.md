Unsurprisingly if you know who I am, you know I'm pretty adverse to writing things from scratch. At Artsy we needed an indoor mapping system and the choices on CocoaPods were pretty bare. I took an existing mapping library and basically rewrote it for our internal use. Then [dblock](http://code.dblock.org) turned it into a real open source project.

So I have no commits, but many, many hours of keyboard time.

One of the cool things about writing the mapping almost from scratch was that I could re-use our existing architecture for asynchronous zooming into images. Doing this meant getting some of the oldest code in the Artsy apps out into the light, and getting it robustly tested.

Finally, working with [dblock](http://code.dblock.org) in OSS has been a real pleasure. Mainly cause he did all the work.
