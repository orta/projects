# Speed Saver

To keep the pace that I wanted on dev I had to give up on videogames. This kinda sucked. I find gaming to be an interesting art form and love the narrative abilities of the medium. So I traded playing games for occasionally watching Starcraft 2 matches on [sc2casts.com](http://sc2casts.com). The downside to this was that it gave depth but not quantity.

To make up for the lack of diveristy I created a screensaver that downloads speed runs of classic games. It keeps the last played state and will continue through thousands of games. You can choose between different systems and whether to stream or download. I wanted to add a CRT emulator to it but eventually just gave up on pixel shareds - PRs welcome.
