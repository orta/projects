# Snapshots plugin for Xcode

We've been using Snapshots in Artsy to ensure visual awesomeness in our apps. I was finding it annoying to compare diffs. So I built an Xcode plugin to make that easy. I did a little writeup also on the process on [making an Xcode plugin](http://artsy.github.io/blog/2014/06/17/building-the-xcode-plugin-snapshots/).
