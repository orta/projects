# Red Xcode

### Make the debug Xcode more obvious

It's annoying trying to keep track of which Xcode is the one you're doing work on, no in. I had heard that there is a hidden Red Xcode mode to differentiate between debugging Xcode and dev Xcode, but I could never find out the trigger. Instead I built a plugin that checks for an attached debugger and it will hue shift the icon. Nothing big, nothing fancy, but it's a useful tool to have under your belt.
